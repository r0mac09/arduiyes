// DIGITAL I/O


// Description
// Reads the value from a specified digital pin, either HIGH or LOW.

// Syntax
// digitalRead(pin)

// Parameters
// pin: the number of the digital pin you want to read

// Returns
// HIGH or LOW

// Notes and Warnings
// If the pin isn’t connected to anything, digitalRead() can return either HIGH or LOW (and this can change randomly).

// The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as A0, A1, etc.
// The exception is the Arduino Nano, Pro Mini, and Mini’s A6 and A7 pins, which can only be used as analog inputs.

uint8_t digitalRead(uint8_t pin);


// Description
// Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin.

// If the pin has been configured as an OUTPUT with pinMode(), its voltage will be set to the
// corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for HIGH, 0V (ground) for LOW.

// If the pin is configured as an INPUT, digitalWrite() will enable (HIGH) or disable (LOW)
// the internal pullup on the input pin. It is recommended to set the pinMode() to INPUT_PULLUP to enable the
// internal pull-up resistor. See the digital pins tutorial for more information.

// If you do not set the pinMode() to OUTPUT, and connect an LED to a pin, when calling digitalWrite(HIGH),
// the LED may appear dim. Without explicitly setting pinMode(), digitalWrite() will have enabled the internal
// pull-up resistor, which acts like a large current-limiting resistor.

// Syntax
// digitalWrite(pin, value)

// Parameters
// pin: the pin number

// value: HIGH or LOW

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as A0, A1, etc.
// The exception is the Arduino Nano, Pro Mini, and Mini’s A6 and A7 pins, which can only be used as analog inputs.

void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value);


// Description
// Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output.
// See the description of (digital pins) for details on the functionality of the pins.

// As of Arduino 1.0.1, it is possible to enable the internal pullup resistors with the
// mode INPUT_PULLUP. Additionally, the INPUT mode explicitly disables the internal pullups.

// Syntax
// pinMode(pin, mode)

// Parameters
// pin: the number of the pin whose mode you wish to set

// ANALOG I/O


// Description
// Reads the value from the specified analog pin. Arduino boards contain a multichannel,
// 10-bit analog to digital converter. This means that it will map input voltages between 0 and
// the operating voltage(5V or 3.3V) into integer values between 0 and 1023. On an Arduino UNO,
// for example, this yields a resolution between readings of: 5 volts / 1024 units or, 0.0049 volts (4.9 mV)
// per unit. See the table below for the usable pins, operating voltage and maximum resolution for some Arduino boards.

// The input range can be changed using analogReference(), while the resolution can be changed
// (only for Zero, Due and MKR boards) using analogReadResolution().

// On ATmega based boards (UNO, Nano, Mini, Mega), it takes about 100 microseconds (0.0001 s) to
// read an analog input, so the maximum reading rate is about 10,000 times a second.

// You need to use analogReadResolution() to change it to 12 bits.

// Returns
// The analog reading on the pin (int). Although it is limited to the resolution of the analog to
// digital converter (0-1023 for 10 bits or 0-4095 for 12 bits).

// Notes and Warnings

// fluctuate based on a number of factors (e.g. the values of the other analog inputs, how close your hand is to the board, etc.).

uint16_t analogRead(uint8_t pin);


// Description
// Configures the reference voltage used for analog input (i.e. the value used as the top of the input range). The options are:

// Arduino AVR Boards (Uno, Mega, etc.)

// DEFAULT: the default analog reference of 5 volts (on 5V Arduino boards) or 3.3 volts (on 3.3V Arduino boards)
// INTERNAL: an built-in reference, equal to 1.1 volts on the ATmega168 or ATmega328P and 2.56 volts on the ATmega8 (not available on the Arduino Mega)
// INTERNAL1V1: a built-in 1.1V reference (Arduino Mega only)
// INTERNAL2V56: a built-in 2.56V reference (Arduino Mega only)
// EXTERNAL: the voltage applied to the AREF pin (0 to 5V only) is used as the reference.
// Arduino SAMD Boards (Zero, etc.)
// AR_DEFAULT: the default analog reference of 3.3V
// AR_INTERNAL: a built-in 2.23V reference
// AR_INTERNAL1V0: a built-in 1.0V reference
// AR_INTERNAL1V65: a built-in 1.65V reference
// AR_INTERNAL2V23: a built-in 2.23V reference
// AR_EXTERNAL: the voltage applied to the AREF pin is used as the reference
// Arduino SAM Boards (Due)
// AR_DEFAULT: the default analog reference of 3.3V. This is the only supported option for the Due.

// Syntax
// analogReference(type)

// Parameters
// type: which type of reference to use (see list of options in the description).

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// After changing the analog reference, the first few readings from analogRead() may not be accurate.

// Don’t use anything less than 0V or more than 5V for external reference voltage on the AREF pin!
// If you’re using an external reference on the AREF pin, you must set the analog reference to
// EXTERNAL before calling analogRead(). Otherwise, you will short together the active reference voltage (internally generated) and
// the AREF pin, possibly damaging the microcontroller on your Arduino board.

// Alternatively, you can connect the external reference voltage to the AREF pin through a 5K resistor,
// allowing you to switch between external and internal reference voltages. Note that the resistor will
// alter the voltage that gets used as the reference because there is an internal 32K resistor on the AREF pin.
// The two act as a voltage divider, so, for example, 2.5V applied through the resistor will yield 2.5 * 32 / (32 + 5) = ~2.2V at the AREF pin.

void analogReference(uint8_t type);


// Description
// Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED at varying brightnesses or drive a
// motor at various speeds. After a call to analogWrite(), the pin will generate a steady square wave of the
// specified duty cycle until the next call to analogWrite() (or a call to digitalRead() or digitalWrite()) on
// the same pin. The frequency of the PWM signal on most pins is approximately 490 Hz. On the Uno and similar boards,
// pins 5 and 6 have a frequency of approximately 980 Hz.

// On most Arduino boards (those with the ATmega168 or ATmega328P), this function works on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11.
// On the Arduino Mega, it works on pins 2 - 13 and 44 - 46. Older Arduino boards with an ATmega8 only
// support analogWrite() on pins 9, 10, and 11.
// The Arduino DUE supports analogWrite() on pins 2 through 13, plus pins DAC0 and DAC1. Unlike the PWM pins,
// DAC0 and DAC1 are Digital to Analog converters, and act as true analog outputs.
// You do not need to call pinMode() to set the pin as an output before calling analogWrite().
// The analogWrite function has nothing to do with the analog pins or the analogRead function.

// Syntax
// analogWrite(pin, value)

// Parameters
// pin: the pin to write to. Allowed data types: int.
// value: the duty cycle: between 0 (always off) and 255 (always on). Allowed data types: int

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// The PWM outputs generated on pins 5 and 6 will have higher-than-expected duty cycles.
// This is because of interactions with the millis() and delay() functions, which share the
// same internal timer used to generate those PWM outputs. This will be noticed mostly on
// low duty-cycle settings (e.g. 0 - 10) and may result in a value of 0 not fully turning off the output on pins 5 and 6.

// Zero, Due & MKR Family
// 12 bits analog pins

// Description
// analogReadResolution() is an extension of the Analog API for the Arduino Due, Zero and MKR Family.

// Sets the size (in bits) of the value returned by analogRead(). It defaults to 10 bits (returns values between 0-1023) for
// backward compatibility with AVR based boards.

// The Due, Zero and MKR Family boards have 12-bit ADC capabilities that can be accessed by changing the resolution to 12.
// This will return values from analogRead() between 0 and 4095.

// Syntax
// analogReadResolution(bits)

// Parameters
// bits: determines the resolution (in bits) of the value returned by the analogRead() function. You can set this between 1 and 32.
// You can set resolutions higher than 12 but values returned by analogRead() will suffer approximation. See the note below for details.

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// If you set the analogReadResolution() value to a value higher than your board’s capabilities,
// the Arduino will only report back at its highest resolution, padding the extra bits with zeros.

// For example: using the Due with analogReadResolution(16) will give you an approximated 16-bit number with
// the first 12 bits containing the real ADC reading and the last 4 bits padded with zeros.

// If you set the analogReadResolution() value to a value lower than your board’s capabilities,
// the extra least significant bits read from the ADC will be discarded.

// Using a 16 bit resolution (or any resolution higher than actual hardware capabilities)
// allows you to write sketches that automatically handle devices with a higher resolution ADC when
// these become available on future boards without changing a line of code.

void analogReadResolution(uint8_t bits);


// Description
// analogWriteResolution() is an extension of the Analog API for the Arduino Due.
// analogWriteResolution() sets the resolution of the analogWrite() function.
// It defaults to 8 bits (values between 0-255) for backward compatibility with AVR based boards.
// The Due has the following hardware capabilities:
// 12 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed to 12-bit resolution.
// 2 pins with 12-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
// By setting the write resolution to 12, you can use analogWrite() with values between 0 and 4095 to exploit the
// full DAC resolution or to set the PWM signal without rolling over.
// The Zero has the following hardware capabilities:
// 10 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed to 12-bit resolution.
// 1 pin with 10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter).
// By setting the write resolution to 10, you can use analogWrite() with values between 0 and 1023 to exploit the full DAC resolution
// The MKR Family of boards has the following hardware capabilities:
// 4 pins which default to 8-bit PWM, like the AVR-based boards. These can be changed from 8 (default) to 12-bit resolution.
// 1 pin with 10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
// By setting the write resolution to 12 bits, you can use analogWrite() with values between 0 and 4095 for PWM signals;
// set 10 bit on the DAC pin to exploit the full DAC resolution of 1024 values.

// Syntax
// analogWriteResolution(bits)

// Parameters
// bits: determines the resolution (in bits) of the values used in the analogWrite() function.
// The value can range from 1 to 32. If you choose a resolution higher or lower than your board’s hardware capabilities,
// the value used in analogWrite() will be either truncated if it’s too high or padded with zeros if it’s too low. See the note below for details.

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// If you set the analogWriteResolution() value to a value higher than your board’s capabilities,
// the Arduino will discard the extra bits. For example: using the Due with analogWriteResolution(16) on
// a 12-bit DAC pin, only the first 12 bits of the values passed to analogWrite() will be used and the last 4 bits will be discarded.
// If you set the analogWriteResolution() value to a value lower than your board’s capabilities,
// the missing bits will be padded with zeros to fill the hardware required size.
// For example: using the Due with analogWriteResolution(8) on a 12-bit DAC pin,
// the Arduino will add 4 zero bits to the 8-bit value used in analogWrite() to obtain the 12 bits required.

// Parameters
// pin: the pin on which to stop generating the tone

// Returns

// Notes and Warnings
// If you want to play different pitches on multiple pins, you need to call noTone() on one pin before calling tone() on the next pin.

void noTone(uint8_t pin);


// Description
// Reads a pulse (either HIGH or LOW) on a pin. For example, if value is HIGH,

// pulseIn(pin, value, timeout)

// Parameters
// pin: the number of the pin on which you want to read the pulse. (int)
// value: type of pulse to read: either HIGH or LOW. (int)
// timeout (optional): the number of microseconds to wait for the pulse to start; default is one second (unsigned long)

// Returns
// the length of the pulse (in microseconds) or 0 if no pulse started before the timeout (unsigned long)

uint64_t pulseIn(uint8_t pin, uint8_t type, uint64_t timeout = 0);


// Description
// pulseInLong() is an alternative to pulseIn() which is better at handling long pulse and interrupt affected scenarios.
// Reads a pulse (either HIGH or LOW) on a pin. For example, if value is HIGH,
// pulseInLong() waits for the pin to go from LOW to HIGH, starts timing, then waits for the pin to go LOW and stops timing.
// Returns the length of the pulse in microseconds or gives up and returns 0 if no complete pulse was received within the timeout.
// The timing of this function has been determined empirically and will probably show errors in shorter pulses.
// Works on pulses from 10 microseconds to 3 minutes in length. This routine can be used only if interrupts are activated.

// Description
// Shifts in a byte of data one bit at a time. Starts from either the most (i.e. the leftmost) or least (rightmost) significant bit.

// Parameters
// dataPin: the pin on which to input each bit (int)
// clockPin: the pin to toggle to signal a read from dataPin

// Description
// Shifts out a byte of data one bit at a time. Starts from either the most (i.e. the leftmost) or least (rightmost) significant bit.
// Each bit is written in turn to a data pin, after which a clock pin is pulsed (taken high, then low) to indicate that the bit is available.
// Note- if you’re interfacing with a device that’s clocked by rising edges, you’ll need to make sure that the clock pin is low before the call to shiftOut(),

// Description
// Generates a square wave of the specified frequency (and 50% duty cycle) on a pin. A duration can be specified, otherwise the wave continues until a call to noTone(). The pin can be connected to a piezo buzzer or other speaker to play tones.
// Only one tone can be generated at a time. If a tone is already playing on a different pin, the call to tone() will have no effect. If the tone is playing on the same pin, the call will set its frequency.

// Parameters
// pin: the pin on which to generate the tone
// frequency: the frequency of the tone in hertz - unsigned int
// duration: the duration of the tone in milliseconds (optional) - unsigned long

// Returns

// Syntax
// delay(ms)

// Parameters
// ms: the number of milliseconds to pause (unsigned long)

// Returns
// Nothing

// Notes and Warnings
// While it is easy to create a blinking LED with the delay() function, and many sketches use short delays for such tasks as switch debouncing,
// the use of delay() in a sketch has significant drawbacks. No other reading of sensors, mathematical calculations,
// or pin manipulation can go on during the delay function, so in effect, it brings most other activity to a halt.
// For alternative approaches to controlling timing see the millis() function and the sketch sited below.
// More knowledgeable programmers usually avoid the use of delay() for timing of events longer than 10’s of milliseconds unless the Arduino sketch is very simple.

// Certain things do go on while the delay() function is controlling the Atmega chip however,
// because the delay function does not disable interrupts. Serial communication that appears at the RX pin is recorded,
// PWM (analogWrite) values and pin states are maintained, and interrupts will work as they should.

void delay(uint64_t ms);


// Description
// Pauses the program for the amount of time (in microseconds) specified as parameter.

// Currently, the largest value that will produce an accurate delay is 16383.
// This could change in future Arduino releases. For delays longer than a few thousand microseconds, you should use delay() instead.

// Syntax
// delayMicroseconds(us)

// Parameters
// us: the number of microseconds to pause (unsigned int)

// Returns
// Nothing

void delayMicroseconds(uint32_t us);


// Description
// Returns the number of microseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program. This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately 70 minutes.
